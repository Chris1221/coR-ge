First we might want to look at a simple summary of the MAF to see if there are any super weird bins that might be affecing the generation of scores to make them abnormally high or low. 

```{r}
table <- data.table::fread("/scratch/hpc2862/CAMH/new_corge/summary/stats.txt", h = T)

hist(table$all_maf)
hist(table$missing_data_proportion)
```
