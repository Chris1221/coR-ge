```{r setup, include = F}
library(dplyr)
```


First we might want to look at a simple summary of the MAF to see if there are any super weird bins that might be affecing the generation of scores to make them abnormally high or low. 

```{r, message = F}
table <- data.table::fread("/scratch/hpc2862/CAMH/new_corge/summary/stats.txt", h = T)
```

```{R}
hist(table$all_maf)
```

Obviously this is nowhere near Uniform. We're going to git rid of all of the MAF below 0.01 and try again.  

```{R}
table %>% filter(all_maf > 0.01) %>% select(all_maf) %>% unlist %>% as.double %>% hist
```

Once we get rid of the rare variants then the MAFs look more reasonable. We're going to go forward and trim them like this going forward.
