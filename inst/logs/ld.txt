595600 (of 595600) markers to be included from [ 3_3_out.map ]
Warning, found 1000 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ plink.nosex ]
1000 individuals read from [ 3_3_out.ped ] 
1000 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
0 males, 0 females, and 1000 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 595600 SNPs
1000 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 595600 SNPs
After filtering, 1000 individuals with non-missing status
